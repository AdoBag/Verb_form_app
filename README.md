# Verb_form_app

- I made this Windows app because my father wanted for me to busy during the summer before my senior high school year. He persuaded me to create an app that would help him learn irregular English verbs.
- This app is written using C# and the entire GUI (and some code variables) are in Lithuanian. However, I feel free to try it out.
- The project is unpolished as it was my first extracurricular programming project and I decided to keep it like this for sentimental value. Nonetheless, with my current knowledge I could add uncountably many features and remake it entirely, so, maybe someday...
